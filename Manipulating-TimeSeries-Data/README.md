# Manipulating Time Series Data with Python - Practice Documentation

## Overview

This notebook documents my practical work and exercises from the "Manipulating Time Series Data" course. Through hands-on coding exercises, I implemented time series manipulation techniques using Python's Pandas library, working with real datasets to gain practical experience in temporal data analysis.

## What I Accomplished

This documentation captures my journey through learning time series data manipulation, from basic concepts to building a complete financial index. I worked through comprehensive exercises that taught me to handle time-indexed data, perform complex resampling operations, and create meaningful financial analytics using real market data.

## My Learning Journey

### Chapter 1: Working with Time Series in Pandas

In this section, I practiced:
- Creating and manipulating DateTimeIndex objects in Pandas
- Building time series from scratch using date ranges
- Implementing time-aware DataFrame operations
- Performing data shifting and lag operations
- Calculating period-specific returns on financial data
- Working with different date frequencies and periods

**Key Skills Developed:**
- DateTimeIndex creation and manipulation
- Time-based data indexing and slicing
- Temporal data alignment and joining

### Chapter 2: Basic Time Series Metrics & Resampling

Through practical exercises, I learned to:
- Implement various resampling techniques (upsampling/downsampling)
- Convert between different time frequencies (daily to monthly, etc.)
- Normalize multiple time series for comparison
- Calculate time-based aggregations (sum, mean, last, first)
- Handle missing data in time series contexts

**Key Skills Developed:**
- Frequency conversion and resampling
- Time series normalization techniques
- Comparative time series analysis

### Chapter 3: Window Functions: Rolling & Expanding Metrics

I implemented various window-based calculations:
- Rolling window statistics (moving averages, standard deviations)
- Expanding window calculations for cumulative metrics
- Custom window functions for specialized analyses
- Performance metrics using windowed operations
- Trend analysis through rolling calculations

**Key Skills Developed:**
- Rolling and expanding window operations
- Moving average implementations
- Statistical trend analysis
- Custom aggregation functions

### Chapter 4: Building a Value-Weighted Stock Index

In this capstone project, I:
- Constructed a value-weighted index using real market data
- Processed market capitalization data from stock exchange listings
- Integrated 2016 historical stock price information
- Calculated appropriate weights based on market values
- Implemented index rebalancing procedures
- Benchmarked my index against standard market indices
- Analyzed performance metrics and risk characteristics

**Key Skills Developed:**
- Financial index construction
- Market capitalization weighting
- Performance benchmarking
- Risk-return analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Libraries and Tools Used
- **Pandas**: Primary tool for all time series operations
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations and array operations
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization and plotting
- **Datetime**: Date and time manipulation utilities

### Data Sources Worked With
- Real stock exchange listing data with market capitalizations
- Historical stock price datasets (2016 data)
- Financial benchmark indices for comparison
- Various time series datasets for practice exercises

### Programming Techniques Applied
- Time series indexing and slicing
- Frequency conversion and resampling
- Rolling and expanding window calculations
- Custom aggregation functions
- Data normalization and standardization
- Performance metric calculations

## Practical Applications Demonstrated

Through this coursework, I demonstrated ability to handle:
- **Financial Analysis**: Stock price analysis, index construction, performance evaluation
- **Data Processing**: Large time series datasets, missing data handling, frequency conversions
- **Statistical Analysis**: Moving averages, volatility calculations, trend identification
- **Visualization**: Time series plotting, performance comparisons, trend analysis

## Project Outcomes

### Value-Weighted Index Results
- Successfully constructed a custom value-weighted stock index
- Implemented proper rebalancing methodology
- Achieved meaningful performance comparison against benchmarks
- Demonstrated understanding of financial index construction principles

### Technical Proficiency Gained
- Advanced Pandas time series functionality
- Complex data manipulation workflows
- Financial data analysis techniques
- Performance optimization for large datasets
