# Rossmann Store Sales Forecasting

A comprehensive time series forecasting project predicting daily sales for Rossmann drugstore chain using multiple modeling approaches including statistical models, machine learning, and ensemble methods.

##  Project Overview

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores across 7 European countries. This project tackles the challenge of predicting daily sales for 1,115 stores in Germany for up to 6 weeks in advance. Accurate sales forecasting enables better staff scheduling, inventory management, and strategic planning.

**Competition**: [Kaggle Rossmann Store Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales)
**Evaluation Metric**: Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE)

##  Dataset Description

### Key Features
- **Sales**: Daily turnover (target variable)
- **Store**: Unique store identifier
- **Date**: Date of sales record
- **Customers**: Number of customers per day
- **Open**: Store operational status (0=closed, 1=open)
- **Promo**: Daily promotion indicator
- **StateHoliday**: State holiday types (a=public, b=Easter, c=Christmas)
- **SchoolHoliday**: School closure indicator
- **StoreType**: Store model categories (a, b, c, d)
- **Assortment**: Product range levels (a=basic, b=extra, c=extended)
- **CompetitionDistance**: Distance to nearest competitor
- **Promo2**: Continuous promotion participation

##  Implementation Pipeline

### 1. Data Analysis & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Sales Trends**: Weekly and monthly seasonality patterns
- **Distribution Analysis**: Sales distribution across stores and time
- **Promotional Impact**: Effect of promotions on sales performance
- **Day-of-Week Patterns**: Weekly sales cycles
- **Store Type Comparison**: Performance variations by store categories
- **Correlation Analysis**: Feature relationship mapping

### 2. Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
- **Missing Value Handling**: Imputation strategies for competition and promotion data
- **Time-Based Features**: 
  - Cyclical encoding (sin/cos) for seasonality
  - Calendar features (year, month, day, quarter)
  - Weekend and holiday indicators
- **Lag Features**: Historical sales patterns (7, 14, 30-day lags)
- **Rolling Statistics**: Moving averages and volatility measures
- **Store-Level Statistics**: Aggregated performance metrics
- **Competition Features**: Logarithmic distance transformation
- **Categorical Encoding**: Label encoding for store attributes

### 3. Modeling Approaches

#### Simple Baseline Models
- **Mean Model**: Store-level average sales
- **Last Day Model**: Previous day's sales as prediction
- **Moving Average**: 7-day rolling average

#### Statistical Time Series Models
- **ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonality)**: Exponential smoothing with additive components
- **ARIMA**: Auto-ARIMA with seasonal components (weekly seasonality)
- **Prophet**: Facebook's forecasting tool with multiple seasonality

#### Machine Learning Models
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting with comprehensive feature engineering
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees (implemented framework)

### 4. Model Evaluation & Selection
- **Validation Strategy**: Time series cross-validation
- **Metric**: Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE)
- **Performance Comparison**: Systematic evaluation across all models
